## Development

Amplication is constructed of multiple packages. To start working on Amplication follow the "Amplication Server" and "Amplication Client" installation instructions.

### [Amplication Server](./packages/amplication-server/README.md)

Amplication Server is the main component of the platform that provides all the core functionality to design and create low-code applications.
The server exposes a GraphQL API for all actions. The server is built with the following awesome open-source technologies: Node.js, NestJS, Prisma over PostgreSQL, GraphQL API, and many more...

### [Amplication Client](./packages/amplication-client/README.md)

Amplication Client is the front end of the platform that provides you with an easy to drive UI for building your next low-code application.
The client is based on React, Apollo client, Primer components, React Material Web Components, Formik, and more.

### [Amplication CLI](./packages/amplication-cli/README.md)

Define your data model and generate apps faster using Amplication Command Line Interface (CLI). Execute pre-defined scripts to create your app instantly.

## Other packages

### [Amplication Data Service Generator](./packages/amplication-data-service-generator/README.md)

Amplication Data Service Generator is the component that generates the code of apps built with Amplication. It generates the models, Prisma client, REST API, GraphQL, authentication and authorization filters, and more. This package is used internally by Amplication server.

To use this package as a library or as a CLI with other projects, follow the instructions on the package page.

## Beta version

Amplication is currently in Beta version. It means that we are still working on essential features like production-ready hosting, migrations, and stability to our console.

How does it affect you? Well...., it mostly doesn't.<br />
Every app generated using Amplication platform contains popular, documented, secured, and supported production-ready open source components & packages. Your app is stable, scalable, and production-ready you can deploy and rely on. You can read more about the generated app and its stack here https://docs.amplication.com/docs/getting-started
